# Completed-IPL-EDA-Analysis
This project performs an in-depth **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on IPL match data using Python libraries like **Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn**.

## 📂 Dataset
- `matches.csv` - Contains match details
- `deliveries.csv` - Ball-by-ball data

## 🔍 Key Analyses
1. **Scoring Patterns:** Runs scored across different phases of the match (Powerplay, Middle Overs, Death Overs).
2. **Dismissal Trends:** How batsmen get out (caught, bowled, LBW, etc.).
3. **Team Performance:** Comparison of run rates across different teams.
4. **Extras & Wickets:** Trends in extras and wicket-taking effectiveness.
5. **Bowler & Batsman Insights:** Strike rates, partnerships, and economy rates.

## 📊 Visualizations
- Histograms, bar charts, scatter plots, box plots.
- Correlation heatmaps and pairplots.
- Team-wise and season-wise performance trends.


## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone <[repository-url](https://github.com/PranayHalder731/Completed-IPL-EDA-Analysis)>

2.Open ipl_eda.ipynb in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.

3. Run all the cells to generate insights.
